JPremium is an authorization BungeeCord plugin. JPremium is different from other popular authorization plugins. The plugin has a very necessary feature, which many servers need, automatically login premium players. The plugin works based on a limbo server structure. That means you have to have a separate Spigot server which is the limbo server. On the below image, you can see the limbo server is an authorization server, where players login or register. 

## Features
* Automatic registration and login premium players.
* Full support changing nicknames by premium players (only if `fixedUniqueIds` option is enabled).
* Using official Mojang servers to authorise premium players.
* Premium players cannot steal a cracked account by change premium nicknames.
* Sessions for cracked players. They do not have to login every joining.
* Automatic starting sessions after cracked players login.
