## Introduce
Nowadays the majority of servers transform into networks with many backend servers connected with one proxy server, therefore standard authorization plugins do not perform their function today. The plugins became obsolete, they do not catch up with the server progress, they do not use fully the latest Minecraft features. So, I  want you to present JPremium.

JPremium is an advanced BungeeCord authorisation plugin. JPremium is different from other popular authorization plugins. The plugin has very necessary features, which many servers need, automatically login premium players and sessions for cracked players. List of all features with description you can find below.

## Features
* JPremium logins **automatically premium players**. They also can disable that feature and login with a password. Automatic registration is dependent on your JPremium configuration. You can set automatic registration premium players, but then cracked players with premium nicknames cannot join to the server.
* JPremium has fully **supported changing premium nicknames**. Premium players who change their nickname will not lose any data and will not be able to steal any cracked accounts. Please remember that feature works only when you have enabled `fixedUniqueIds` in your JPremium configuration. If you have not enabled that option, premium players will not be able to join the server after changing their nickname.
* JPremium has **sessions for cracked players**. When cracked players have a session, they do not have to login every joining. You can set automatic starting sessions for specified time after registration and login.
* JPremium has **protection against bots**. The first protection is forbidding joining if JPremium detects too many joining requests. Even if bots join the server, bots cannot register because JPremium requires entering **captcha codes from maps**. You can change the icon on the captcha maps.
* JPremium has a special **registration form**, so you can choose that players can only register on your website. The registration form has an advanced anti-bot system - **Google Recaptcha**.
* JPremium connects all not logged players with the **limbo server**. They have to login or register there and then they will be connected with the main server or their last server on which they were before quitting from the server. When one of the servers is shut down, all players from that server will be redirected to the limbo server. And when that server comebacks, all redirected players will be connected to that server again.
* JPremium forbids joining directly with Spigot servers without your BungeeCord server. The plugin uses access tokens to validate connections. It is a very good means of protection, but please remember that any plugins do not warrant full protection, I recommend having a firewall!
* JPremium uses **salted SHA-256** to hash cracked player passwords. The plugin also requires entering strong passwords by cracked players. You can also limit registration from one IP address.
* JPremium is **fully configurable**, so you can change almost all features and messages.
