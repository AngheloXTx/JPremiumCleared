# Introduce
JPremium is an authorization BungeeCord plugin. JPremium is different from other popular authorization plugins. The plugin has a very necessary feature, which many servers need, automatically login premium players. The plugin works based on a limbo server structure. That means you have to have a separate Spigot server which is the limbo server. On the below image, you can see the limbo server is an authorization server, where players login or register.
