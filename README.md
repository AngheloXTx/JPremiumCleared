## Introduce
JPremium is an authorization BungeeCord plugin. JPremium is different from other popular authorization plugins. The plugin has a very necessary feature, which many servers need, automatically login premium players. The plugin works based on a limbo server structure. That means you have to have a separate Spigot server which is the limbo server. On the below image, you can see the limbo server is an authorization server, where players login or register. 

## Features
* JPremium logins automatically premium players. They also can disable that feature and login with a password. Automatic registration is dependent on your JPremium configuration. You can set automatic registration premium players, but then cracked players with premium nicknames cannot join to the server.
* JPremium has fully supported changing premium nicknames. Premium players who change their nickname will not lose any data and will not be able to steal any cracked accounts. Please remember that feature works only when you have enabled `fixedUniqueIds` in your JPremium configuration. If you have not enabled that option, premium players will not be able to join the server after changing their nickname.
* JPremium has a session feature for cracked players. When cracked players have a session, they do not have to login every joining. You can set automatic starting sessions for specified time after registration and login.
